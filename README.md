# Wordpress-lookup
JS algorithm that identifies if the website is built on Wordpress and its version.

Meant to be used on node BE 

Basic idea is that a API like builtwith.com costs money if you want to use it and WjvCheck doesnt really work as it should so I came onto the idea of making my own algorithm that would to the same more effectively.

Technologies used:
1. javascript
2. JS co generators
3. request promises
4. regex generators

HOW TO: 
It is up to you how you wanna use the function. Passed param is a websites url. If you get error you shouldt get first check for the functions and change the http to https or vice versa.

Soon there will be a full project using this algorithm.
